  <h2>Reflection and Insights</h2>
  <p> My website is about a bakery shop which also serve desserts and cafe at the same time. This website contains information about the shop, menu, home pafe and the contact is page.</p>
  <p>DFirstly, I started the assignment with the Wordpress Site and I choose Neve theme for the website. From there, I customize the theme according to my favor and how the bakery website should be. I put some informations and picture for cakes and desserts that I would like to sell on my website and made 4 tabs such as Home Page, About Us page, Menu Page and Contact page. For plugins, I used Autoptimize to optimize html, CSS and JavaScript so that website is fast and smooth, Duplicate Page to duplicate a layout of page I want to reuse, WPtouch mobile plugin to make it responsive for mobile screens. </p>
    <p>Then, I moved on to Joomla. In Joomla, I have to use HTML, inline CSS to put content rather than WYSIWYG editor because I do not have the full control in this editor. Images and text appear different on the site.So, I tried to construct Joomla site as my WordPress site. I used helixultimate template. I deleted unnecessary things from the template such as Social Icons, Social Share, print icon and etc. I try put contents in the same positions as WordPress such as information about my bakery contact information, sign-up form, menu of the bakery and prices, the purpose of the shop and video about the bakery. I have to use different plugins such as Embed Google Map fot the location. For responsiveness, template does the job for me. </p>
    <p>After doing this project, I feel like I have learned enough to make websites using Joomla and WordPress. They are both good in their own ways in that with Joomla, I can write source code to put content and with WordPress, I can just drag and drop videos, images and type in texts. But, both needs plugins and modules to be more useful. In the end, CMS software are huge and take time to get used to but once you get the hang of it, you can explore more and make your website better, more secure and optimized just in one place which is efficient and effective for businesses.</p>
